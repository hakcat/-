One fourth from the teacher, one fourth from own intelligence,
One fourth from classmates, and one fourth only with time.

This beautiful verse describes how we can imbibe the amrit of knowledge by easily understanding the underlying stages.
This wonderful verse occurs in ujjvala commentary of Haradatta on Apastamba dharma sUtra, prasna 1,  khanda 7, sutra 29.
